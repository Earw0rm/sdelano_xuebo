// by convention, registers x0-x7 are used for syscall arguments
// x8 is used to store syscall number
// NOTE:
// Such wrapper functions are usually not included in the kernel itself 
// â€” you are more likely to find them in the different language's standard libraries,
// such as (glibc) [https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/]
